Extra Credit 2 is in a separate branch.

There are 3 React components with storybook: A stateless FavoriteButton; a stateful wrapper of the FavoriteButton, FavoriteButtonWithState, that allows the button to be toggled by clicking it; and a ButtonTestContainer that displays 3 FavoriteButtonWithState and controls the total count of buttons in the 'on' state.
